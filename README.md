## Welcome to Samantha Coyle's Research Page

This research was started Spring 2018 with Mr. Greg LaKomski and Dr. Apan Qasem of Texas State University.

### Motivation

Algorithmic efficiency has become hugely important due to the need to analyze massive data sets generated by cloud computing and the Internet of Things. While making algorithms more succinct and comprehensive, recursion can also be highly inefficient when applied to these data sets. As an alternative to recursion in many applications, dynamic programming techniques can significantly improve runtime efficiency. Although runtime efficiency has been widely studied for specific problem applications, less attention has been given to the relationship of language and underlying architecture to a broader measure of efficiency that includes both runtime and resource consumption. This investigation explores and compares runtime efficiency and resource consumption for both recursive and dynamic programming across several different programming languages that abstract widely differing architectural elements. In order to get a broad understanding of the relationship between recursive algorithms and dynamic algorithms, the widely applicable Fibonacci algorithm was chosen as a simple means of keeping the algorithm as constant as possible, while maintaining feasibility for the monitoring of resources across several programming languages. A full comparison of all studied languages is presented, the potential factors behind the results analyzed and the possible ramifications for actual use discussed.

### Objectives
```markdown
- Learn about profile monitoring utilities for complex processes
- Access the functionality and limitations of the perf command line resource monitoring utility
- Gain an understanding of the architectural differences among a variety of programming languages, to include compiled versus interpreted
- Determine how programming languages with differing architectural components affect runtime, task-clock time, CPU-cycles, instruction count, page-faults, and cache-misses
- Analyze how recursive algorithms compare to dynamic algorithms in resource consumption and runtime efficiency
