# Research
This repo contains information regarding my research with Mr. Greg LaKomski, and Dr. Apan Qasem of Texas State University. This investigation explores and compares runtime efficiency and resource consumption for both recursive and dynamic programming across several different programming languages that abstract widely differing architectural elements. We decided to change the focused to solely C++ and Python. The results of the research so far were presented at the Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) Conference at Texas State University (March 2018), and the research is being continued.
