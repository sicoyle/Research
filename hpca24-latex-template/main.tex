\begin{abstract}

This investigation explores and compares runtime efficiency and resource consumption 
for both recursive and dynamic programming across several different programming languages that abstract widely differing architectural elements. Utilizing the Fibonacci algorithm, we show that for the algorithms investigated, compiled languages demonstrated measurably better runtime efficiency than the in-ter-preted languages studied. An example is the compiled Go language. Compared to Python, which is in-ter-preted, Go was on av-erage, 1267.44 percent faaster in execution for the recursive algorithm, but 1395.18 percent slower for the dynamic algorithm. At the same time, the results indicated that the compiled languages required more computational resource in pursuit of this faster execution. Looking again at Go compared to Python for the recursive algorithm, Go utilized, on average, 100.02 percent of available processor resource versus 97.67 percent for Python. As for the dynamic algorithm, Go utilized, on average, 101.92 percent of the available processor resource, and Python utilized, on average, 94.92 percent. These results are interesting, taking into account lower machine instruction counts for the compiled languages. A full comparison of all studied languages is presented, the potential factors behind the results analyzed and the possible ramifications for actual use discussed.

\section{Introduction}
Algorithmic efficiency has become hugely important due to the need to analyze massive data sets generated by cloud computing and the Internet of Things. While making algorithms more succinct and comprehensive, recursion can also be highly inefficient when applied to these data sets. As an alternative to recursion in many applications, dynamic programming techniques can significantly improve runtime efficiency. Although runtime efficiency has been widely studied for specific problem applications, less attention has been given to the relationship of language and underlying architecture to a broader measure of efficiency that includes both runtime and resource consumption.

Different programming languages are utilized for different purposes, which leads to the question of when to use one language over another? Compiled languages utilize a compiler to take the whole program as input and compile it only once. They generally execute faster than interpreted languages and take up more memory to create the object code as output [1]. Interpreted languages utilize an interpreter, which reads in a single line of code at a time. Because the syntax tree is processed directly to evaluate or execute statements, some of the code may be processed over and over again, resulting in slower execution for interpreted languages [1]. Some common examples of compiled languages include C and Go. Common examples of interpreted languages include Python and Perl. 

This paper presents comparisons between several different programming languages, to include interpreted and compiled, and analyzes their performance efficiencies. As a way to make Python more comparable to the compiled language of C, ways of code optimization were explored. As a result, a version of inline C and a Python implementation with a decorator function to store the results needed later for computation were tested.

\section{Background}

In this section, there will be a list of several key concepts and formulas relevant to this research. While this work focuses mainly on C and Python, the generalizations mentioned can be applied to the general concept of compiled languages as opposed to interpreted languages. For this research, C and Go were chosen as the compiled languages, and Perl and Python were chosen for the interpreted languages. 

\subsection{Programming Languages}	

The programming language of C, created in 1972, is often chosen when speed is a priority for large data sets of input [2]. C is useful for system programming and for creating operating systems; C is the basis of the programming languages of Java and C++. Go is typically a close second place when it comes to speed. Go is a relatively new programming language useful for systems programming and with scalable network servers. Today, Perl, a scripting language, is used for text processing and system administration, among other things. The interpreted language of Python is a general-purpose language with many utilizations. It, too, is a powerful scripting language. These languages were chosen due to their popularity and speed for testing purposes.

We utilized four languages in our study:

\begin{itemize}
\item C is a compiled language created in 1972 at Bell Labs for UNIX system implementation [1]. C is the basis of the programming languages of Java and C++. It is often chosen when speed is a priority for inputs consisting of large data sets [2]. Although it isn't the most simple language to develop with, it is a major player in High Performance Computing (HPC) because of its efficiency in performance [3].
\item Go is a relatively new programming language created by Google. Go is useful for systems programming and scalable network servers. It is a close second behind C when it comes to speed, and is a relatively simple language to develop with [3]. It is based upon C's implementation; however, it was developed with a focus on a simpler design for the programmer [3]. 
\item Python is an interpreted language created in 1991 [4]. It has recently ADDDDDDDDDDDDD
\item No page limit for references.
\item The references must include complete author lists (no {\em et al.}).
\item Authors of {\em all} accepted papers will be required to give a lightning presentation (about 90s) and a poster in addition to the regular conference talk.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Decorated Python}

As a way to make Python more comparable to the execution speed of C, a decorator function with a wrapper was implemented. Decorator functions are more commonly utilized for tracing, locking, or logging [5]. However, a decorator function combined with a Python wrapper can also be created as a way to make a program more dynamic by having it remember the results needed later for computation. This allowed its performance to be much quicker than that of C.

\subsection{Inline C}

A method to optimize C was also explored utilizing the keyword "inline" before the function call. Inline is a useful tool with smaller functions that will be called multiple times in order to reduce function overhead. Utilizing the inline keyword reduces function call overhead by replacing the actual call with the contents of the function itself. Because of this replacement of the function call with the function contents, it is not very useful with multiple recursive calls as there will be a tradeoff in terms of instruction count and efficiency.

\section{Experimental Methodology}

In the following subsections, the different aspects of this study will be described.

\subsection{Environment}

In this subsection, the elements used to set up the environment will be described. We used an Intel NUC NUC5CPYH with ubuntu 16.04 installed, a gcc version of 5.4.0, and python 2.7. We installed the other necessary languages for the experiment, so that the NUC had Perl, Python, C, and Go installed. We also installed perf, a resource monitoring utility, so that we could monitor the resource consumption of the different languages.    

\subsection{Execution}

The algorithm used for testing was the Fibonacci algorithm gathered from Rosetta Code [7]. Rosetta Code is a repository which contains different algorithms with many programming languages to choose from. A recursive and dynamic version of the Fibonacci algorithm was used from this site for the testing algorithm. Fibonacci values of 20, 30, 40, and 50 were used as function parameters for testing purposes.

\subsection{Analysis}

A profile monitoring resource was used to monitor the resource consumption of the algorithms in order to collect data. Perf is a sample based Linux profiler which monitors Linux perf events [8]. It was utilized for every trial, testing task-clock, CPU-cycles, instruction count, the number of CPUs utilized, clock rate, instructions per second, elapsed time, page-faults, cache-misses, and percent of all cache references. The time command was also used to calculate the time sum consisting of user and system time. Speedup was calculated using the execution times between the different languages.

\textbf{Please ensure that you include page numbers with your
submission}. This makes it easier for the reviewers to refer to different
parts of your paper when they provide comments.

Please ensure that your submission has a banner at the top of the
title page, similar to
\href{http://hpca2018.ece.ucsb.edu/docs/hpca24.pdf}{this one},
which contains the submission number and the notice of
confidentiality.  If using the template, just replace XXX with your
submission number.

\subsection{Content}

\noindent\textbf{\sout{Author List.}} Reviewing will be double blind;
therefore, please do not include any author names on any submitted
documents except in the space provided on the submission form.  You must
also ensure that the metadata included in the PDF does not give away the
authors. If you are improving upon your prior work, refer to your prior
work in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the
bibliography.  For example, if you are building on {\em your own} prior
something like: "While the authors of
additionally does W, and is therefore much better."  Do NOT omit or
anonymize references for blind review.  There is one exception to this for
your own prior work that appeared in IEEE CAL, workshops without archived
proceedings, etc.\, as discussed later in this document.

\noindent\textbf{Figures and Tables.} Ensure that the figures and tables
are legible.  Please also ensure that you refer to your figures in the main
text.  Many reviewers print the papers in gray-scale. Therefore, if you use
colors for your figures, ensure that the different colors are highly
distinguishable in gray-scale.

\noindent\textbf{References.}  There is no length limit for references.
{\bf Each reference must explicitly list all authors of the paper.  Papers
not meeting this requirement will be rejected.} Authors of NSF proposals
should be familiar with this requirement. Knowing all authors of related
work will help find the best reviewers. Since there is no length limit
for the number of pages used for references, there is no need to save space
here.

\section{Paper Submission Instructions}

\subsection{Guidelines for Determining Authorship}


IEEE guidelines dictate that authorship should be based on a {\bf
  substantial intellectual contribution}. It is assumed that all
authors have had a significant role in the creation of an article that
bears their names. In particular, the authorship credit must be
reserved only for individuals who have met each of the following
conditions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Made a significant intellectual contribution to the theoretical
  development, system or experimental design, prototype development,
  and/or the analysis and interpretation of data associated with the
  work contained in the article;

\item Contributed to drafting the article or reviewing and/or revising
  it for intellectual content; and

\item Approved the final version of the article as accepted for
  publication, including references.

\end{enumerate}

A detailed description of the IEEE authorship guidelines and
responsibilities is available
\href{https://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/Section821.html}{here}.
Per these guidelines, it is not acceptable to award {\em honorary }
authorship or {\em gift} authorship. Please keep these guidelines in
mind while determining the author list of your paper.


\subsection{Declaring Authors}

Declare all the authors of the paper upfront. Addition/removal of authors
once the paper is accepted will have to be approved by the program chair,
since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for
reviewer assignment.


\subsection{Areas and Topics}

Authors should indicate these areas on the submission form as
well as specific topics covered by the paper for optimal reviewer match. If
you are unsure whether your paper falls within the scope of HPCA, please
check with the program chair -- HPCA is a broad, multidisciplinary
conference and encourages new topics.

\subsection{Declaring Conflicts of Interest}

Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site.
Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers.
If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes
a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to
abuse or ``game'' the review system, the paper may be rejected.

Pease declare a conflict of interest (COI) with the following people for any author of your paper:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students,
      and post-doctoral advisees, forever.
\item Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent,
      forever (if they might be potential reviewers).
\item People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years, including
\begin{itemize}
\item co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers.
      whom you fund.
\end{itemize}
\item People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the
last FIVE years.
\item Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend
to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar
with the relationship.
\end{enumerate}

``Service'' collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional
organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting
tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest.
Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with
no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a
conflict among the authors of the different projects.

On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with
whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration
which has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal.
Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them.
Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a
reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or
related to those in your paper.  The PC Chair may contact co-authors
to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.

We hope to draw most reviewers from the PC and the ERC, but others from the
community may also write reviews.  Please declare all your conflicts (not
just restricted to the PC and ERC).  When in doubt, contact the program
chair.

\subsection{Concurrent Submissions and Workshops}

By submitting a manuscript to HPCA'18, the authors guarantee that the
manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in
a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or the archived
proceedings of a workshop (e.g., in the ACM digital library) -- see
exceptions below. The authors also guarantee that no paper that contains
significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted paper will be
under review for any other conference or journal or an archived proceedings
of a workshop during the HPCA'18 review period. Violation of any of these
conditions will lead to rejection.

The only exceptions to the above rules are for the authors' own papers
in (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in the ACM
digital library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper
appear in the archived proceedings), or (2) venues such as IEEE CAL
where there is an explicit policy that such publication does not
preclude longer conference submissions.  In all such cases, the
submitted manuscript may ignore the above work to preserve author
anonymity. This information must, however, be provided on the
submission form -- the PC chair will make this information available
to reviewers if it becomes necessary to ensure a fair review.  As
always, if you are in doubt, it is best to contact the program chair.


Finally, we also note that the IEEE Plagiarism Guidelines \href{http://www.ieee.org/publications\_standards/publications/rights/plagiarism.html}{IEEE Plagiarism Guidelines} covers a range of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or
one's own work.
